**PROJECTS**	
**Drowsiness and Yawning Detection using Facial Landmarks: **                                                                             Nov 2024
●	   Developed a real-time drowsiness and yawning detection system using Python, OpenCV, and dlib, leveraging facial 
   analysis with Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) and Mouth Aspect Ratio (MAR) to detect driver fatigue.
●	  Implemented face detection using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and alarm triggers based on threshold criteria to
  enhance driver safety through continuous monitoring.
●	  Shortlisted in first 5 teams out of 100 teams for hack-A-Roo (Hackathon)

**Analysis of Relation Between Food Diets, Health and COVID-19 using Power BI and Azure:**                        Jul 2023
●	In This project, we collected data from Kaggle and uploaded it to the Azure SQL database
●	 created a Power BI dashboard by pulling data from the Azure database server and uploaded this dashboard to the web

**Goodreads ETL Pipeline using PySpark:**                                                                                                                 Apr 2023
●	The main aim of the project is to capture data in real-time from good reads API using a Python wrapper to store collected data in a local disk and then move to the landing bucket of AWS S3
●	All the ETL jobs are written PySpark and Once ETL job execution is done the Airflow DAG runs the data quality check
